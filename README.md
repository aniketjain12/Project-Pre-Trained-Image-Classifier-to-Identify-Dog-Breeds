# Pre Trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.

## Project Goal
Improving your programming skills using Python.
In this project, you will use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. We ask you to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier.

## Description:
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.

You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

** Note, you DO NOT need to create the classifier. It will be provided to you. You will need to apply the Python tools you just learned to USE the classifier. **

## Dependencies

Each directory has a requirements.txt describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

## pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
