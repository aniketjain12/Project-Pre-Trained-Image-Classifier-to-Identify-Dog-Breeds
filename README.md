# Pre Trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.

## Project Goal
Improving your programming skills using Python.
In this project, you will use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. We ask you to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier.
